The plan was simple:

Wait for the lord of Highwater to be preoccupied with a gala and break in. Intel was given by a shady information broker known as [[Shade]]. Shade told Vendrick's crew that there would be a large score to be had at the baron's mansion during a Gala, as there was to be a tournament held for the amusement of the nobles, and all bets were being held in the Lord's vault.

Vendrick cased the site during the gala and stumbled upon the actively dying knight Ser Pendrick, whom had been stabbed and had his throat slit in a side passageway near the tournament grounds. It was at this point that several guards arrived, and Vendrick was taken away and charged with murder.
