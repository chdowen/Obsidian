16, half elf, thief rogue

Vendrick met Falyn several years ago when his waist satchel wound up missing. Falyn had nabbed it off of him when he was at his side job, being security for the local tavern. He was breaking up a fight when Falyn swiped it and walked off.

Vendrick called in several favors to track down who had been selling his various keepsakes, which led to his encounter with Falyn. She had forgotten who he was (so many pockets to pick, so little time), and attempted to swipe his coin purse when he walked past her in the street. Vendrick, a little more wary after his recent loss, caught her in the act.

He could not, however, find it in him to raise his hand against a starving child from the same slums that he and Dirk grew up in. Instead, he took her in and set her straight. Only rob those more fortunate.
