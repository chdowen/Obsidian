Vendrick grew up in the rough and tumble [[Undercity]]. He has no formal education beyond what he learned in order to survive. He ran with a gang of close confidants he could trust (or could he?). In this gang, there were:
[[Bryes]], the smooth talker
[[Falyn]], the pickpocket
and [[Dirk]], the mastermind.

Vendrick was the muscle of the operation prior to an extended stint in jail due to a [[job gone wrong]].

He was framed for crimes beyond what he was involved in and offered a choice:

Rot in prison for the rest of his life, or be sent to the front lines of the [[siege]].
